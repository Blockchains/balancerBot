##Â Explanation

Developed using Truffle, easy to write, test and deploy contracts, etc.

Initial spec UniSwap <-> Balancer Arbitrage.

As Balancer contract interfaces aren't ready yet decided to [Kyber Network](https://developer.kyber.network/docs/Start/), on-chain liquidity protocol to demonstrate swapping between two protocols. The contract and bot is written in a way that make it easy to swap out the Kyber function for Balancer.

### KyberUniArbContract
Main contract.
By default the address that deploys the contract is the owner.
Only the owner can approve tokens - !!!!Need more explanation. Done via approveToken. This approves the UniSwap exchange contract for a token (via token address). Has to be an ERC20 token!

Approve - UniSwap contract will be trusted but still not best practice?

## Testing

Two approaches to testing.

First unit tests in test folder. Covers:

Second testing full functions on Rinkeby with Kyber/UniSwap functions. See testScriptsKyber.js

## To Do

Tidy/comment testScriptsKyber.js.
Bot tidied & finished.

Add some events/log processing to Bot.

Meta-transaction type method?
  Would allow any user to approve themselves?
  Arb contract just functions as relayer.
  Would still need some kind of approval so no-one takes advantage of contract? Or make it so caller still spends gas, etc.

## Learnings

Caller always pays gas - for everything.

Approve - interesting in general. ERC20 related.

Testing is hard! Is this an opportunity??
  Deploying on Rinkeby & using Uniswap and Kyber implementations there. Hard to find info. Process is fairly complicated.
